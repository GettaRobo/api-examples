# API Examples

## What it does
Shows how to use the Mathpix Latex API via the following means:

1.  A simple 10 line Python script.
2.  A minimal iOS application that crops user images, calls the API, and renders the resulting Latex.

Note: the API is specialized to work on reasonably well cropped images.  In general accuracy and speed improves if the images are well cropped.  Support for poorly cropped and uncropped images isin the pipeline.
